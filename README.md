# Churn-Prediction-using-ml
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses as it helps in identifying customers who are likely to leave the service or stop using the product.
Key Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing and Exploration:

Initial data analysis to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.
Feature Engineering:

Creation of new features that might enhance the model's predictive power.
Transformation of categorical variables using one-hot encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Model Development:

Implementation of various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks.
Use of a robust training pipeline with features scaling, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
Neural Network Model:

Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras.
The model includes layers for fully connected neurons with activation functions optimized for binary classification.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualization of the confusion matrix to compare predicted and actual values.
Implementation of a feature importance analysis to understand the key drivers of customer churn.
Confusion Matrix Visualization:

A confusion matrix is plotted to visualize and evaluate the performance of the classification model. It helps in understanding how well the model distinguishes between churned and non-churned customers.
